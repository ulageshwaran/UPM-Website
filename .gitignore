# Wait, static folder usually has source files, but if collectstatic runs there, it might be ignored. 
# In this project, 'static' seems to be the source directory based on `STATICFILES_DIRS = [ BASE_DIR / "static" ]`
# So we SHOULD NOT ignore 'static/'. 
# But we should ignore 'staticfiles/' or wherever collectstatic goes. 
# settings.py doesn't define STATIC_ROOT. It defaults to None. 
# If they used S3, maybe they didn't set STATIC_ROOT.
# Safe default is to NOT ignore static/ if it's source.
